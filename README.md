# XML-Project---Recipe-box-company-data

## Overview

Modeling of a fictional XML database for the information system of a recipe box company using XML. The database includes recipes, ingredients, customers orders, reviews and delivery people. This database is then exploited by creating visuals with XSL stylesheets, or exploiting it in another XML format or JSON format.

## Features

- An **XML Schema** representing our modeling.
- An **XML database** against this model, containing a representative extract of the database.
- 5 different scenarios requiring the visualization of part of this data using **XSL stylesheets**.
- A 6th scenario requiring the exploitation of the data in another XML format accompanied by another stylesheet.
- A 7th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in **JSON format**, with a stylesheet.
